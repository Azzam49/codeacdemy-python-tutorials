PYTHON SYNTAX
Numbers
Variables can also hold numeric values. The simplest kind of number in Python is the integer, which is a whole number with no decimal point:

int1 = 1
int2 = 10
int3 = -5
A number with a decimal point is called a float. You can define floats with numbers after the decimal point or by just including a decimal point at the end:

float1 = 1.0
float2 = 10.
float3 = -5.5
You can also define a float using scientific notation, with e indicating the power of 10:

# this evaluates to 150:
float4 = 1.5e2
