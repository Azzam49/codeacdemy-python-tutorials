DATE AND TIME
Grand Finale
We've managed to print the date and time separately in a very pretty fashion. Let's combine the two!

from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()

print '%02d/%02d/%04d' % (now.month, now.day, now.year)
print '%02d:%02d:%02d' % (now.hour, now.minute, now.second)
The example above will print out the date, then on a separate line it will print the time.

Let's print them all on the same line in a single print statement!


Example:
print('%02d/%02d/%04d %02d:%02d:%02d' % (now.month, now.day, now.year, now.hour, now.minute, now.second) )
Result:
11/06/2018 14:13:08
