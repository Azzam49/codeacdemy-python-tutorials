STRINGS & CONSOLE OUTPUT
Escaping characters
There are some characters that cause problems. For example:

'There's a snake in my boot!'
This code breaks because Python thinks the apostrophe in 'There's' ends the string. We can use the backslash to fix the problem, like this:

'There\'s a snake in my boot!'




NOTE : If the quotes on above example was double("), the use of backslash wasnt needed .
if we used double(") quotes to close our string and needed use (") inside string we need use backslash.

story = "He was good \"person"

If want use backslash inside the string we double writing the backslash so it get normal and only one will be printed 

story2 = "Which color you want white \\ black?"
