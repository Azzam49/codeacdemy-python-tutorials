String Formatting with %, Part 2
Remember, we used the % operator to replace the %s placeholders with the variables in parentheses.

name = "Mike"
print "Hello %s" % (name)
You need the same number of %s terms in a string as the number of variables in parentheses:

print "The %s who %s %s!" % ("Knights", "say", "Ni")
# This will print "The Knights who say Ni!"
