String Formatting with %, Part 1
When you want to print a variable with a string, there is a better method than concatenating strings together.

name = "Mike"
print "Hello %s" % (name)
The % operator after the string is used to combine a string with variables. 
The % operator will replace the %s in the string with the string variable that comes after it.


If you'd like to print a variable that is an integer, you can "pad" it with zeros using %02d. 
The 0 means "pad with zeros", the 2 means to pad to 2 characters wide, 
and the d means the number is a signed integer (can be positive or negative).

day = 6
print "03 - %s - 2019" %  (day)
# 03 - 6 - 2019
print "03 - %02d - 2019" % (day)
# 03 - 06 - 2019
