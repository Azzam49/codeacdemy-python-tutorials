CONDITIONALS & CONTROL FLOW
Compare Closely!
Let's start with the simplest aspect of control flow: comparators. There are six:

Equal to (==)

>>> 2 == 2
True
>>> 2 == 5
False
Not equal to (!=)

>>> 2 != 5
True
>>> 2 != 2
False
Less than (<)

>>> 2 < 5
True
>>> 5 < 2
False
Less than or equal to (<=)

>>> 2 <= 2
True
>>> 5 <= 2
False
Greater than (>)

>>> 5 > 2
True
>>> 2 > 5
False
Greater than or equal to (>=)

>>> 5 >= 5
True
>>> 2 >= 5
False
Comparators check if a value is (or is not) equal to, greater than (or equal to), or less than (or equal to) another value.

Note that == compares whether two things are equal, and = assigns a value to a variable.
